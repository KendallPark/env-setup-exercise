# Getting Started on Mac
## Install XCode commandline tools
**This is a lengthy install. Get this started and work on other installations concurrently.**

Command Line Tools for Xcode: `xcode-select --install`, https://developer.apple.com/downloads, or [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835)

## Install Git
1. Make sure you have a [Github](http://github.com) account.
2. [Follow Github's instructions for installing Git.](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
3. [Generate a new SSH key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/)
4. [Add the SSH key to your Github account](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/)

## Install Homebrew
**Requirements: Xcode commandline tools must be installed at this point.**

[Follow homebrew's instructions.](http://brew.sh/)

## Next Steps
Individual environment setup instructions are hidden in a fork of this repo. You'll need a working understanding of Git to figure out how to find them.

[Go through this tutorial.](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)

You should be using Git through the terminal. No GUI interfaces yet. It's important to understand what's going on under the hood.

`git remote add fork `

`git pull remote master`
